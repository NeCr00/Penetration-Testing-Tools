# Penetration-Testing-Tools

This repository contains several useful tools for network and web application testing. Each tool serves a specific purpose and is designed to simplify and automate certain tasks. Below is an overview of each tool and its functionality.

## DNS_Resolver

The `DNS_Resolver` tool is used for resolving domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. It takes a list of domains as input and returns a list of IPs along with the resolved domain name. This tool can be handy for network administrators, security professionals, or anyone who needs to quickly obtain IP addresses for a given list of domains.

## Dirb_MultiHost.py

`Dirb_MultiHost.py` is a versatile tool that executes the Dirb command for multiple web applications or paths without the need to run the command individually for each URL. Dirb is a popular web content scanner that is used to discover hidden directories and files on a web server. With this tool, you can provide a list of URLs or paths, and it will automatically run the Dirb command for each one, saving you time and effort during web application testing or vulnerability assessment.

## Port_Explorer

The `Port_Explorer` tool is designed to check a list of IP addresses for the status of a specific list of ports. It allows you to quickly determine whether certain ports on a given set of IPs are open or closed. This tool can be useful for network administrators, penetration testers, or anyone who needs to assess the accessibility of specific ports on multiple hosts.

## Reverse_Dns

The `Reverse_Dns` tool performs reverse DNS lookups, which means it takes an IP address as input and returns the associated domain name. Reverse DNS is commonly used to identify the domain name corresponding to an IP address. This tool can be helpful for troubleshooting, investigating network traffic, or analyzing logs that only provide IP addresses. It provides a convenient way to retrieve the domain names associated with a given set of IPs.
